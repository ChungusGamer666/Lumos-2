  - rscadd: Cat Fighting! A degenerate level Martial Art fit for the degenerate who
      uses it- Felinids. Just hope they don't pull off there Mega-Combo...
  - rscadd: Xenothropy Transformation! Allowing Xeno-Hybrids to call upon there Ancestors
      and become a far weaker Xenomorph! *Still badass regardless*
  - rscadd: Goo Fu! A slimy and grapple heavy Martial Art fit perfectly for a slime!
  - rscadd: Syndicate Forge Bundle! Now you can conquer the land *station* in duels
      of honor, or joust with the Clown and regret your life choices.
  - rscadd: Possessed Flyswatter! Now you can smite anything but pesks! Especially
      Janitors.
