changes:
  - rscadd: added Tribal Claw! Cause it was a sick style built around lizards using
      there tail to gain an advantage in combat.
  - rscadd: added The Art of Origami! Cause god damnit throwing paper planes at people
      was so fuckin funny!
  - rscadd: added Plasma Man fighting style- I mean it already existed but now like
      Tribal Claw it is available only for Plasmaman as that was also available in
      BeeStation. Costs all your TC though.
  - rscadd: added Moth Lamp... Yep, this was a Syndie item and it was pretty funny.
  - rscadd: added Chameleon Bowman Headset- This already existed but now you have
      this option to buy separately as it's own item.
  - rscadd: added Chameleon Flashproof Glasses- Same as above.
  - rscadd: added Chameleon Fireproof Insulated gloves, ditto.
  - rscadd: added Chaplain Purified Nar'Sian constructs. Course the Syndicate got
      there hands on devilish soul shards and cleansed them for a greater use- Or
      more less limited use. Now you can murder with a ghost friend or two!
  - rscadd: added Curator's voodoo doll. Curators are believed to be failed wizards...
      Perhaps that took a different route instead, something far more sinister. Also
      you can force people too say WO- (bzzt, bzzt, thud)
  - rscadd: added ENERGY CHAINSAW!!!! NOW YOU CAN RIP AND TEAR IN STYLE!!!!
  - rscadd: added new Carp'Sie bundle, terrorize the crew with an army of sharks or
      fail miserably and be gunned down instantly!
  - rscadd: added new Syndie Seeds, and thanks to the help of our Russian comrades
      they guarantee only the finest of Marksman rifles will come from these fruits.
  - rscadd: added The Guide to Illusions! The Mime can already bend reality to create
      things that aren't there. Now they can form illusions of items that appear to
      be another! Such as a hardsuit!
  - rscadd: added Fancy Insulated Gloves, yellow is too obvious. Now the Mime can
      truly commit crimes in silence.
  - rscadd: enabled keybind notes!
